# OBR 2019

The Olympiad's main idea is to build a robot and simulate a rescue operation In other words, our robot needed capable to overcome irregular terrain, cross unknown paths, divert from obstacles and rise inclinations for rescuing the victims and transport them to a safe spot. This year, my team and I decided to use an Arduino Mega + Raspberry Pi 3B.

# Arduino

The Arduino was used for the most of things that we needed to do, such things as follow the line, detect and dodge obstacles.

# Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry was used for image proccessing. It was really helpfull for detecting color, checking points, victims, ramps, and also helping the line-follower.

Pre-req.: OpenCV

# Arduino + Raspberry Communication

It was used i2C communication.
